                <p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi
                    would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and
                    so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge
                    of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force
                    is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he
                    was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his
                    apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others
                    from death, but not himself.</p>
